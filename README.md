## Overview:
This repository contains supplementary data and scripts used as part of the final year project titled *"Inferring the Functional Effects of Single Nucleotide Variation in Seventh Pandemic Vibrio Cholerae Genomes."* The project aimed to analyse the genomic data of Vibrio cholerae strains from the seventh pandemic to understand the functional implications of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) within their genomes.

## Data
The data within this repository contains the following supplementary data:

Annotation Files: Annotation files providing information about gene locations, functional annotations, and other relevant genomic features.
SNV Data: Tables or files containing information about single nucleotide variations (SNVs) identified in the Vibrio cholerae genomes.

## Scripts:
The "scripts" directory includes the following scripts used for data analysis and processing:

Data Preprocessing Scripts: Scripts used to preprocess raw genomic data, including quality control, alignment, and variant calling.
Functional Annotation Scripts: Scripts for annotating the functional effects of SNVs
Statistical Analysis Scripts: Scripts used for statistical analysis of SNV data
